    "executionSummary": "User: \"I'm thinking about adding maternity coverage to my policy. What are my options?\"\nAgent Response:\n\n\"The document you've provided focuses on pharmacy services, claims processing, and provider relations within a healthcare context, particularly related to pharmacies and medication claims. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain specific information about insurance policy upgrades, add-on options like maternity coverage, or details about premium calculations.\n\nTo add maternity coverage to your policy or explore your options, here are the general steps you might consider, based on typical insurance procedures:\n\nContact Your Insurance Provider: Reach out to your insurance provider's customer service or your insurance agent. They can inform you about the availability of maternity coverage as an add-on or if you need to switch to a different plan that includes maternity benefits.\nReview Your Current Policy: Check your existing health insurance policy documents to understand your current coverage. This will help you identify any gaps that maternity coverage could fill.\nRequest Information on Available Options: Ask for detailed information on plans that include maternity coverage, including what's covered (like prenatal visits, labor and delivery, and postnatal care) and what's not.\nCalculate Potential Costs: Inquire about the cost differences. Adding maternity coverage or switching to a plan that includes it will likely increase your premiums. Request specific figures to understand the financial implications.\nConsider Your Needs: When reviewing options, consider your needs and preferences, such as the choice of healthcare providers, coverage for complications, and any waiting periods that might apply before the coverage takes effect.\nPersonalized Recommendations: Based on your situation, usage patterns, and future plans, the insurance representative can recommend the most suitable coverage options. They might also suggest other related coverages that could be beneficial, like pediatric care for your new baby.\nMake an Informed Decision: Weigh the costs against the benefits to decide whether adding maternity coverage is right for you. Consider consulting with a financial advisor or healthcare consultant if you're unsure.\"",
