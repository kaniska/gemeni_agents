To add your baby to your plan, you'll need to complete a 'Change of Status' form. This is time-sensitive, so it's important to submit the request within 30 days of birth.\"\n\nCustomer: \"Where can I find this form?\"\n\nAgent: \"You can download it from our website or I can email it to you directly. Once completed, you can email it back or mail it to the address provided on the form.\"\n\nCustomer: \"What information will I need to provide?\"\n\nAgent: \"You'll need your baby's birth date, full name, and social security number if available.
